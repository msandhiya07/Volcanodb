# This dataset has global listing of over 500 significant eruptions, which includes information on the latitude, 
longitude, and various properties of the volcano. The dataset provides details related to the economic and human impact of the eruptions. 
This offers a comprehensive record of historically significant volcanic events.
year : The year of the eruption.
month : Valid values: 1 to 12
day: Valid values: 1 to 31
name: The name of the volcano
location: The volcanic subregion (geographic location)
country: The Country where the volcano is located.
Latitude: (-90 to 90)
Longitude: (-180 to 180)
Elevation (m): The elevation of a volcano in meters (m) above sea level.
type: The volcano type
VEI : Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)
Agent:
The agent that caused the fatalities for an eruption. Adapted from Siebert and Simkin, 1994.
Code Agent
A Avalanche (Debris and landslides)
E Electrical (lightning)
F Floods (& JÃ¶kulhlaups)
G Gas (emission from eruptive craters as well as fumarolic/solfataric activity)
I Indirect deaths (disease, starvation, exposure, desolation)
L Lava flows
M Mudflows/Lahars
m Secondary (post-eruption) mudflows
P Pyroclastic flows, surges, & direct blasts
S Seismic, or volcanic earthquake (tectonic earthquake deaths excluded)
T Tephra (ash, bombs, lapilli, steam blasts). Killing either by ballistic impact, or with finer-grained ash, by suffocation, collapse of ash-covered roofs, etc.
W Waves or tsunami
